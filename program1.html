 <i>Animals are living organisms that belong to the kingdom Animalia<b>. They are <i>multicellular, eukaryotic, and heterotrophic,</i> meaning they depend on other organisms for food. Animals show diverse forms, ranging from tiny insects to large mammals like elephants and whales. Most animals have the ability to move, respond to their environment, and reproduce sexually. They play an important role in maintaining ecological balance, providing food, pollination, companionship, and other benefits to humans. Animals are broadly classified into two groups: vertebrates (with backbone, e.g., fish, birds, mammals) and invertebrates (without backbone, e.g., insects, worms, mollusks).</i></p>
